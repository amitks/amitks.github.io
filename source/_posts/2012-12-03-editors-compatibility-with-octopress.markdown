There are Wordpress plugins to highlight code snippets and The WYSIWYG editor is nice, but very often you need to switch to the HTML editor to enter tags such as pre (to type the brush class) and even tt. Also, you donâ€™t have control of how the HTML code looks because the editor keeps reformatting it. The main advantage of using Octopress is that I can use any editor I want.
