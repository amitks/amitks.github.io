**Hello Octopress**

It feels very nice to switch over Octopress.it is a blogging framework based on jekyll and desined in RUBY.Since there is no need of mysql or any similer type of database system it reduces your effort of management.Store all you data at Github in Flat Files.It's the Feel of Freedom.But it still needs some tweaking to be done for the better look of Blog.

Thank you Tom Preston-Werner(for jekyll) and B mathis(for octopress).
