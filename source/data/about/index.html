<h1>who am i??</h1></br>
First of all welcome to my blog.don't know how you landed here, Google seems to be lousy if related search matches with my posts :p and for hostpitality, Browse what ever you wants thought their is very less to read.Well now it's answer time and it's "I am just a guy who sits infront of his computer 16 hrs a day".....I guess this is not a valid answer but it's my true identity.neverthless i love programming and open source ideology so i think it's not inappropriate to learn and share my experiences to outer world.My thoughts are mesmerised by my past(Few failures of mine) but i think it doesn't matter.
every one can have a new start and differences can be made though you have to keep your self focused.</br>
Damn..!! if i think it doesn't matter why i am not applying new thoughts and doing stuffs that i shouldn't. 
looks like i am inside a while loop with no exit status(literally in a Nutshell).
MY_HOBBY = ["Sleeping","Programming","Gaming"]
